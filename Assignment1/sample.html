			<h2><center>Browser Architecture</center></h2><br>

			<p style="font-size: 30px;"><center>Web Browser is an application software that allows us to view and explore information on the web. User can request for any web page by just entering a URL into address bar.<br><br><br>

			Web browser can show text, audio, video, animation and more. It is the responsibility of a web browser to interpret text and commands contained in the web page.<br><br><br>

			Browser architecture simply explains the inputs from keyboards via OS API's and then making calls to HTTP client using network interface. Then parsing HTML pages(rendering engine) and showing results to the display.</center></p>

It takes input from the keyboard or mouse, interpret it and make other services to work on the basis of input it receives.</center><br><br><center><b>Interpreter</b> receives the information from the controller and execute the instruction line by line. Some interpreter are mandatory while some are optional For example, HTML interpreter program is mandatory and java interpreter is optional.</center><br><br><center><b>Client Program</b> describes the specific protocol that will be used to access a particular service.</center></p>

      			<h1>Architecture of Chrome</h1><br>
      			<p><center>The multi-process architecture of Google Chrome differentiates it from other browsers. Each tab has its own process, which runs independently from the browser. This allows one tab process to dedicate itself to a single web-application, thereby increasing browser performance.<br><br>Chrome Apps integrate closely with a user's operating system. They are designed to be run outside of a browser tab, to run robustly in offline and poor connectivity scenarios and to have far more powerful capabilities than are available in a typical web browsing environment. The app container, programming, and security models support these Chrome App requirements.</center></p>
